# Weekly Challenge 02: Logical Thinking
# CS/MATH 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2023
***

Weekly challenges (WC) invite you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. They may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. They may be attempted individually or in teams as indicated. If in teams, the intention is for the buddies to discuss the solution among themselves, rather than splitting the tasks among themselves.

# Purpose

This WC invites you to think in a manner required for problem solving, and in designing proofs. You may need to spend a good amount of time thinking about this problem and it is unlikely that you will get it in a single sitting. Start discussing the problem with your buddy early.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- the willingness to ponder over a problem
- the time and persistence to think over the problem
- the ability to state your thoughts concisely and compellingly
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Grading

Grading is on attempt. We trust that you are doing the necessary work and award you full marks for your submission. To verify, one or more teams will be selected at random each week for a viva on their submission. If any of the members is unable to explain the submission or does not appear for the viva, the team will be considered unreliable. Unreliable teams will be awarded a 0 in the corresponding WC as well as all WC's since their last viva.

# Task

The task for this WC is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space in the same file. Make sure to include any supporting files needed for successful compilation. The same file at the time of the submission deadline will be taken to be your submission.

# Deadline and discussion

_Deadline_: 2359h on Sun, 22 Jan
